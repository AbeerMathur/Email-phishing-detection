## Overview

**CatPhish AI** is a real-time phishing email detection system built on the research work titled **"Unified Approach Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms for Detection of e-Mail Phishing Attacks"**, published at the **2024 International Conference on Computing, Sciences and Communications (ICCSC)**.

This application leverages a hybrid ensemble of NLP-powered **Support Vector Machine** and **Random Forest** models. It delivers precise classification of email content as **Phishing Email** or **Safe Email**, and is backed by a Flask API and a Chakra UI React frontend.

## Research Summary

### Abstract
With the ever-rising risk of phishing attacks, which capitalize on vulnerable human behavior in the contemporary digital space, requires new cybersecurity methods. This literary work contributes to the solution by novel incorporation of three techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Random Forest (RF). Utilizing NLP for deep analysis of text in phishing e-mails, SVM for strong categorization and Random Forest's decision making by group helps in improving detection. This combination of language and pattern analysis along with group learning builds a fortified system. This approach differs from prior work on a variety of factors such as reliability, security, integrity, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and robustness. Thorough evaluation on a reliable dataset aimed to demonstrate the method's effectiveness, which resulted in 98.7 % of accuracy in detection. This majorly aims at showcasing the potential of ensemble techniques to combat against cyber-attacks like phishing for laying a strong foundation for a secure digital environment.

## Methodology

### 1. Dataset

- **Source:** Public Kaggle Dataset ‚Äî *Phishing Email Detection*
- **Samples:** 11,376 safe emails + 7,274 phishing emails
- **Features:** 
  - `Email Text`
  - `Email Type` (Phishing / Safe)

### 2. Preprocessing

- Missing value handling
- Train-test split with reproducibility seed
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** (max features: 10,000, English stopwords removed)

### 3. Unified Model Architecture

- **VotingClassifier** (soft voting)
  - `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=20)`
  - `SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True, C=1)`
- Optimized with:
  - Grid Search
  - Cross-validation (5-fold)
  - Class weighting (phishing: 2, safe: 1)

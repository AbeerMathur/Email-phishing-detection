## CatPhish AI: Email Phishing Detection using an Ensemble ML Approach

---

## Overview

**CatPhish AI** is a real-time phishing email detection system built on the research work titled **"Unified Approach Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms for Detection of e-Mail Phishing Attacks"**, published at the **2024 International Conference on Computing, Sciences and Communications (ICCSC)**.

This application leverages a hybrid ensemble of NLP-powered **Support Vector Machine** and **Random Forest** models. It delivers precise classification of email content as **Phishing Email** or **Safe Email**, and is backed by a Flask API and a Chakra UI React frontend.

## Project Highlights

- **Problem Addressed:**  
  With over 3.4 billion phishing emails sent daily and incidents taking up to 295 days to detect, email phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat.

- **Solution Provided:**  
  A unified ensemble model combining:
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for semantic understanding
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for high-precision classification
  - **Random Forest (RF)** for decision robustness

- **Backend:** Python Flask API serving a `.pkl` model trained via Scikit-learn.
- **Frontend:** React + Chakra UI user interface.
- **Deployment:** Dockerized and deployed on Render.

## Research Summary

### Abstract

> Phishing attacks exploit human vulnerabilities through deceptive emails. This study introduces a unified approach integrating **Natural Language Processing**, **Support Vector Machine**, and **Random Forest**, achieving a remarkable **98.7% accuracy**. The ensemble is optimized using **TF-IDF vectorization**, **grid search**, and **5-fold cross-validation**, offering a transparent and robust phishing detection solution.

## Methodology

### 1. Dataset

- **Source:** Public Kaggle Dataset ‚Äî *Phishing Email Detection*
- **Samples:** 11,376 safe emails + 7,274 phishing emails
- **Features:** 
  - `Email Text`
  - `Email Type` (Phishing / Safe)

### 2. Preprocessing

- Missing value handling
- Train-test split with reproducibility seed
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** (max features: 10,000, English stopwords removed)

### 3. Unified Model Architecture

- **VotingClassifier** (soft voting)
  - `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=20)`
  - `SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True, C=1)`
- Optimized with:
  - Grid Search
  - Cross-validation (5-fold)
  - Class weighting (phishing: 2, safe: 1)
